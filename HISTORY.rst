History
=======

0.3.0 (2016-10-03)
------------------

* Now jsail recognizes as timestamp keys ``timestamp``,
  ``time``, ``@fields.timestamp``, ``@fields.time``.
  And similarly, for message these keys are checked:
  ``message``, ``msg``, ``@fields.message``, ``@fields.msg``.
* Now jsail quietly skips lines which can't be parsed
  as single JSON document.

0.2.1 (2016-03-13)
------------------

* Fixed issue with STDIN bufering. Previously,
  input given from STDIN was buffered and sometimes
  ``jsail`` didn't show content until buffer fills up.
  Now this behaviour is fixed.

0.2.0 (2015-07-06)
------------------

* 'anyjson' was added into the requrements list.
* Now jsail will process STDIN if filename wasn't given as a command line argument. This makes possible to use it in unix pipelines.

0.1.0 (2015-04-16)
---------------------

* First release on PyPI.
